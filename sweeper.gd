# The devourer for the chase legs (homage to Crash Bandicoot's boulder
# runs and, ultimately, Indiana Jones). A street sweeper grinds south
# down the corridor, eating the path behind it. It is SLOWER than a
# hustling, pulling dog but FASTER than the owner's phone-zombie dawdle -
# so it never scares the oblivious owner, and it is on YOU to drag the
# dead weight south ahead of the brushes. Stop to sniff around and the
# gap closes. Its leading (south) edge is the kill line.
