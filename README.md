# Touch Grass

*Take the Path of Leash Resistance.*

A top-down physics comedy game. You are the dog. Your human is glued to
their phone and walking on autopilot. Get them to the park with the phone
intact — dodge the bikes, mind the manholes, and sneak in as much sniffing
as you can get away with.

Built in Godot 4.7, GDScript, currently all placeholder vector art.
Playtest builds ship to a private itch.io page.
The default dog is modeled after Millie, a distinguished salt-and-pepper
mutt who squats like a lady.

## Controls

- Move: WASD / arrows / left stick
- Dig in (anchor yourself; the leash stops the human. Doubles as the
  squat when nature calls): hold Space / A
- Pee (mark spots for points; five marks completes the territory quest):
  hold Q / X
- Bark (freezes the human for a beat): E / B
- Restart: R / Start

## What to feel for

- It is a tug of war you lose on raw muscle: the human is four times your
  mass and will yank you around. You win by bracing (plant), leverage
  (pole wraps multiply your holding power like a capstan), and timing.
- Plant yourself before bike lanes so the human strains against the leash
  and grinds to a stop. Release when clear.
- A hard yank while anchored makes the human stumble toward you; doing it
  as a bike whizzes past is a NICE SAVE and builds your streak.
- The leash is a real rope. Wind it around a pole as many turns as you
  like - the coil cinches when taut, the pull curves around the pole
  (tetherball!), and a hard enough wrench slips the whole coil off.
- The fling: wind the human around a pole and keep pulling. Instead of
  jamming against it they WHIRL - orbiting faster the harder you pull
  (the leash is a pulley) - and launch TOWARD you when the rope runs
  out. A fast fling sails past you, and then it is your turn to be
  yanked along: the bungee. Winding the human up or flinging them
  across danger is a core move.
- Dog business is dog business: pee anywhere with Q - marking hydrants
  and poles scores, five marks secures the territory, stray breaks just
  leave a puddle. The test tube lasts about nine breaks, and a full
  bladder slows you down. Once per walk nature calls for a longer stop -
  find a safe moment, or the dog will pick the moment for you. Then
  watch the owner: they walk to it, bag it, and carry it to the nearest
  bin, and that whole errand is yours to protect (or sabotage).
- A wound leash is a pulley: the dog pulling one end multiplies the drag
  on the human around the pole, all the time, not just during the whirl.
- Open holes swallow dogs too. Watch your own paws.
- A marked bike lane runs alongside the sidewalk: fast commuters hold
  their line, kids on scooters weave everywhere - including onto the
  sidewalk. The far shoulder has good sniffing, if you dare cross.
- Squirrels. A nearby squirrel pulls at you - literally, your paws drift
  toward it - and chasing one pays bones even though it always escapes
  at the last second. Bark to scare them off when duty calls.
- The human owns the retractable leash. "click!" means they just changed
  its length on a whim — sometimes reeling you in against your will.
- The human telegraphs every event with a speech bubble: "ring ring" stops,
  "typing..." drifts, "ooh!" dashes, "selfie!" backs up blindly,
  "filming..." walks backwards, "tired..." heads for a bench.
- Sniffing hydrants and eating dropped kebabs scores bones, but every
  second sniffing is a second the human spends unsupervised.

## Development

Requires Godot 4.7. A portable copy lives in `godot/` locally (gitignored);
grab it from https://godotengine.org/download or the GitHub releases.

Run:
```
godot\Godot_v4.7-stable_win64.exe --path .
```

Headless smoke test (same as CI):
```
godot\Godot_v4.7-stable_win64_console.exe --headless --path . --quit-after 1800
```

Web export (needs export templates installed, see AGENTS.md):
```
godot\Godot_v4.7-stable_win64_console.exe --headless --path . --export-release "Web" build/web/index.html
```
